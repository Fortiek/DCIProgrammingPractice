<h1>Integrated Web Design: The Meaning of Semantics (Take I)</h1>

<!--This next one doesn't render at all, assuming it's a comment-->

<!--Adding white-space for readability-->
By Molly Holzschlag.<br/><!--Line break, as rendered-->

Nearly every web designer is guilty of forcing line breaks, 
creating tables that don't hold tabular data, and a host of other egregious
 <strong>HTML</strong><!--Given our discussion Tue, assuming this
is 'strong' to add semantic meaning--> 
sins. Now that CSS is around, 
Molly E. Holzschlag slaps our hands and explains why we should pay 
attention to each element's content, not just its looks.
<!--Next heading appears 'smaller' than the first, indicating it should be
at least one level lower than the first-->
<h2>Semantics Is Meaning</h2>

<!--The next tag looks italicized, but from the reading we can gather
this, like the appearence of the 'HTML' from earlier should carry
semantic meaning. (Helps for screen readers to convey meaning)-->
In English, the word <em>semantic</em> means "of or relating to meaning." 
In the science of linguistics, semantics is more explicit: It's the study
 of meaning based on the historical and psychological significance of 
 words and terms. 

<!--Another heading, though smaller still than the second heading so far...
Yet again, at least one level lower-->
<h3>H1 Does Not Mean "Big, Bold, and Ugly"</h3>

There are many examples of how a 

<!--This one is tricky... Appears as larger text, though not in the vein
of 'strong' or 'b', instead, just seems like the text is bigger...
NOT SUGGESTED, however there appears to be a tag with property values that
will render in the way we're looking for from an older version of HTML.
The <font> tag with the size="x" property.-->
<font size="+1">markup element</font> 

can be meaningful, but 
I've found none as crystal clear as the use of headings. If you've been 
designing web sites for a while, you've probably run across this problem: 
You want to use a heading, but you really dislike the font size that the 
h1 element produces. So you go with an h3 because it produces a much nicer 
look. (I used to do this all the time!) But markup was never really meant 
to be presentational.

<!--This heading actually seems to be the same size as the previous heading
so we'll set it too an <h3>-->
<h3>A Few Other Suspects</h3>

Along with headings, paragraphs, and breaks, many of us have been guilty 
of using other elements without concern for semantics, paying little or 
no attention to when we can put them to work to better help define our 
content. Here are a couple of instances of each:

<!--Next, we have a list of bullet points... an Unordered List. <ul>
Can't forget each item on the list needs to be designated as its own
<li> or else multiple things will display on the same line.-->

<!--One issue I have is the order they appear in the ref doc is different
than what's provided in the initial doc... There doesn't seem to be a 
discernable order though, so assuming it's a typo and not a sort run through
a JS function.-->
<ul>
    <li>blockquote.</li>
    <li>table.</li>
    <li>address.</li>
    <li>dl.</li>
</ul>

<!--Another heading, larger than the previous two, so we go back up in 
importance to a lvl 2 heading.-->
<h2>Mean What You Write, Write What You Mean</h2>
When we author HTML and XHTML documents that are structured and semantic 
rather than presentational, we can do a lot more with our content, 
producing documents that are

<!--Another unordered list-->
<ul>
    <li>Far more ready for styling effectively with CSS</li>
    <li>Faster loading, by virtue of reduced page weight</li>
    <li>More accessible</li>
    <li>Sharable across numerous devices, from the rich visual environment 
        of the 
        desktop to the plain, content-oriented interface of the cell phone
    </li>
</ul>

<!--And that finished out our doc. Now it should render the same as the 
example provided (minus the ordering of the first list... I'll ask about
that.)-->
