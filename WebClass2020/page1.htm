        <!--Initial display included a bunch of 'white-space' in the code
        Which isn't rendered in the browser-->

        <!--Next, adding tags to incorporate line breaks (<br/>) helps to 
        designate where we want new lines to begin; this doens't add tabular
    spaces however....-->

        <!--Finally, adding the character entities, (Those chars that start
        with the ampersand (&) indicates we want to add special characters
    to render in the browser that would normally be reserved for starting
    tags, (&lt for 'Less Than') tag endings, (&gt for 'Greater Than') and
    tabular spaces. (&nbsp for 'Non-Breaking SPace') -->

    <!--Next step is to add the <h1> tag without closing it....-->
    <!--Upon reloading, it treats all trailing content as a lvl 1
    heading-->

    <!--Finally, closing the <h1> tag makes the document render the way it's
        expected to.-->

        HTML is an acronym for HyperText&nbsp;    Markup Language.<br/>
            &nbsp;It is a tag-based language.<br/>
        Examples of tags are &lt;head&gt; or &lt;body&gt;.
    
        <!--Initial implementation of the opening of the line break tag
        without closing it confused the browser; initially, it treated it as
        the end of the document.-->
