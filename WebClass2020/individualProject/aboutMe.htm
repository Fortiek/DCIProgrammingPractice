        <h1>Birth</h1>
        <p>
            Born to a Kathy E. and Matthew A. in New Milford, Connecticut in the small hours of the morning of the 23rd of January.
            Since then I've been raising Cain! (If lounging around and playing with code in one form or another counts as raising Cain, 
            then sure. Weirdo.)
        </p>
        <h1>Early Life</h1>
        <p>
            Spent the first few years moving around a bit in the state with my mother, though never really leaving Litchfield county.
            I have memories starting from about four years old, and most of them are remarkably bland, save for one instance of a 
            'glitch in the matrix' when I was spending time with my maternal grandfather. That's a story you'll have to ask about though!
            Around the sixth year of life, my mother settled in at the house she now currently resides, and thus the rest of my youth
            was spent in the small town of Warren, where the most jaw-dropping attraction we had was a lone traffic light in the center
            of town! (In case you were wondering, yes, it really is that quiet of a town.)
        </p>
        <h1>Modern Day</h1>
        <p>
            The beginnings of the 2010's saw a lot of changes happening very quickly, as is often the case when you leave the structure
            of mandatory schooling. 2011 I graduated from high school, 2012 I shipped off too basic training for the Marine Corps and spent 
            the next four years bouncing from the east coast too the west coast, Japan, Australia, South Korea, and Indonesia! These four years
            were filled with a lot of good times and a lot of not-so-good times, but it afforded my the opportunity to pursue a higher
            level of education than I would otherwise have been comfortable with, and many other opportunities to boot! Now, I'm working full
            time in the civilian sector, and working on breaking in to my dream career; full-stack web development! Could you be the next
            part of journey towards personal and professional growth!?
