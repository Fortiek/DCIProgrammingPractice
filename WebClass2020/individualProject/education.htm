        <!--Some notable aspects of time spent in educational institutions-->

        <p>
            As a high school student, I was part of the founding roster for the Oliver Wolcott Wildcats football team. 
            When our time with the program was coming to an end, there were six of us remaining from the original Freshman class.
            You can read about it <a href="https://www.registercitizen.com/news/article/Six-Wildcat-seniors-have-stuck-with-Wolcott-12107233.php" target="_blank" title="News article in the Torrington Register Citizen">here!</a>

        <p>
            During my time at Post University, I was part of a new program as well; the AVIS Gaming Club! While our mission
            was to be a group of like-minded individuals that loved to share the joy of play across platforms and boundaries,
            it provided many opportunities to learn and grow in a professional sense as well! <br/>

            As a gaming club, we attracted faculty attention for our knowledge of current, relevant gaming technologies. 
            This prompted them to assign us helper tasks to get a program director onboard to lay the foundations for an eSports
            team!
